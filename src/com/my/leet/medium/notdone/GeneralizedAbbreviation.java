	/*
	 * Write a function to generate the generalized abbreviations of a word.
	 * Example: Given word = "word", return the following list (order does not
	 * matter): ["word", "1ord", "w1rd", "wo1d", "wor1", "2rd", "w2d", "wo2",
	 * "1o1d", "1or1", "w1r1", "1o2", "2r1", "3d", "w3", "4"]
	 * 
	 * Understand the problem: A classic dfs + backtracking problem. A trick here is
	 * if we've already abbrivate part of a word, we must jump at least a character.
